# Using_API

For this project, you simply need to make a small JavaScript project that makes an HTTP request to one of these APIs and shows the data in some way, whether it is text or images, or anything else. Try to style the content a little so that it's easy to look at, but CSS isn't the focus for this project so it doesn't have to look too fancy. I will attach the fetch code example that I created last week so that you can reference it. You are not allowed to use the same cat API as the example for your own project :).


You may use other APIs besides the ones that I have listed here, but I picked these specifically because they look relatively easy to get started with and they look like they have decent documentation, so pick other ones at your own risk.
